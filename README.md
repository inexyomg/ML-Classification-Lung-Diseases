The object of development was an algorithm for detection and classification of respiratory diseases on X-ray images using machine learning methods. 
With the increasing number of respiratory diseases, there is a growing need for effective and accurate methods for their early diagnosis. 
The aim of this work was to develop an algorithm capable of detecting and identifying respiratory diseases by analyzing chest X-rays.

The development of the program is based on a comprehensive approach to the study of disease detection and classification. 
First, various approaches to image preprocessing and segmentation of lung disease detection areas are examined. 
The next step is to explore options for disease detection methods using transfer learning methodology as well as an ensemble of models to take advantage of the strengths of each individual model and improve overall performance. 
The accuracy of the developed algorithm was 97% and the F1-score was 0.96. It is important to emphasize that the developed program and its analogues cannot be applied in medical institutions without proper supervision by a physician. 
Such an algorithm can serve as an auxiliary tool in the diagnostic process, but it is important to keep in mind that it does not replace the experience and judgment of qualified physicians.  

This thesis examines the development of medical imaging. 
Future research directions may include exploring additional preprocessing methods, integrating more diverse data sets, and developing more complex models to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the algorithm.
